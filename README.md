I've created a js file with some todos data in it, which I'm imported into this file. (Normally this data would come from an API call, not a local file).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenge: Using the array map method, render a child component for each todo item in the todosData array and pass the relevant data to it.
