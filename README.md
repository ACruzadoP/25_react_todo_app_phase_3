Let's practice props and mapping components on our todo list app!<br /><br />

I've created a js file with some todos data in it, which I'm imported into this file. (Normally this data would come from an API call, not a local file). <br /><br />

Challenge: Using the array map method, render a child component for each todo item in the todosData array and pass the relevant data to it.
